Just walked out of Last Bullet. My brain's like a maze, stuffed full of thoughts and the smell of stale popcorn. Seriously, what even was that ending? The main guy, Leon or Liam or something, stands in that empty alley like he's waiting for a bus that's never gonna come. Honestly, reminds me of when I wait for inspiration, and all I get is more confusion. You notice how his jacket was the wrong size? Slept through half the  , woke up to find out he was still wearing it. Ugh my back's killing me, these theater seats are worse than medieval torture.

> There’s this part, mid- , where shadows play tricks like cats over rooftops. That's when I realized, we all chase shadows, but really we just want a good latte. Or a nap. 

Forgot to mention, someone said I should 𝘥𝘰𝘸𝘯𝘭𝘰𝘢𝘥 the   for later. Might just 𝘸𝘢𝘵𝘤𝘩 the   with captions, make sense of the warbling dialogue. Was it just me, or did the sound mix make everyone’s lines sound like they were underwater back there? And why did Rebecca never pick up the harp again? The harp was a metaphor or something, right? Maybe we all need a metaphor to survive these echoing halls, crammed full of loud whispers.

I swear, after that car chase, my seat was vibrating like I swallowed a jackhammer. Imagine eating soup during an earthquake, and that's kind of how my stomach feels right now. Oh, right — that scene where the old man fed pigeons like they were an audience, yeah, what did that mean? Pigeons understand more than I do, I think. 

Did anyone else hear that infomercial voice in the middle? You too can blah blah blah. Maybe I nodded off for an infomercial sneak peek? Sleep is a slippery mermaid, and I think I slipped into its grasp more than once. Gotta check this out on the 𝘥𝘰𝘸𝘯𝘭𝘰𝘢𝘥, see where reality actually split.

Random tidbit: the aisle smelled faintly of cotton candy. Cannot explain. My notebook was no help, just like me forgetting birt𝘏𝘋ays. 

Ah, I gotta run. Code follows my labyrinthed mind, perfect match:

```csharp
int main() {
    return ? shadow + true;
}
```
